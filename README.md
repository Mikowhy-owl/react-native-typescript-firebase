# react-native-typescript-redux

### React native application with firebase and typescript.  
Simple react application that allows user to create account or login on firebase by email and password. To test you should create 2 users - on that has "isAdmin" set to true (add it in firebase console) and the second normal user. Normal user can create simple post, admin can apply it so that it is visible on dashboard.

#### Running
You have to set firebase config of course.

As normal react-native app - yarn install && yarn start
